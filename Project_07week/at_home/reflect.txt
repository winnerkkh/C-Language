1. Function is a group statement that includes types, and the name of the function with two different parameters. It performs a task based on the statement indicated. I think functions are needed because of their reusability and clarity. The functions can be used as many times as we would like to use them by declaring the functions only one time in the global area. Thus, this does not make the syntax long and hard to follow, and looks clear, short and easy to follow. So the programmer and maintenance programmers can easily understand syntax and the code.

2. The two functions I used in workshop 6 (addPositive and subtractPositive) provided me with the convenience to use them multiple times even though each time for different purposes. As I mentioned above in the answer for the first question, as a result of using them, I did not need to declare new functions one by one for each usage, but instead, used all of them throughout my code by declaring them just once. Furthermore, my syntax looks much more concise, easier to write and more readable by using those two functions.

3. The identifier in a function is absolutely needed in order to be able to send and receive data back to and from functions. The identifier value is defined through return value at the end, and then assigned to the specifier, and we use the specifier again whenever we need to send and receive data to and from functions by calling the defined identifier.
