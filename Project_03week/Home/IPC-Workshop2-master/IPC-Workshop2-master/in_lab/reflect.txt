I learned important functions through this week's workshop how to use them properly in the syntax such as multiple declarations, scanf, printf and constant values with using proper format. However, I think I must keep practicing and get used to using many functions because I know all of functions in my head but when I actually tried to use them during the lab, it was really confusing. I think there are more things that I have to study but I am eager to learn more things during the IPC lecture.
